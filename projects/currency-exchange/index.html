                    <p class="about__description">Exchanging currencies can be frustrating for many users due to 
                        high fees, poor exchange rates, and complex processes. AfriBDC is a Canada-based fintech 
                        platform that addresses these challenges by offering multi-currency wallets (foreign accounts),
                         peer-to-peer exchanges, direct currency swaps, sending money at fair rates. I worked on designing the 
                         AfriBDC currency exchange app to create a seamless experience tailored to user needs. As 
                         the sole designer, I owned the entire design process—from user research and user flows to 
                         wireframes, prototypes, and usability testing. Designing multi-currency wallets and P2P 
                         exchange flows was particularly challenging, but it strengthened my ability to simplify 
                         complex fintech experiences.

                        From there, I created low-fidelity wireframes and prototypes to test how easily users could complete these tasks.

                <p class="about__description">I created an interactive prototype that demonstrates the app functionality 
                    and can be used for testing. The goal was to test the core features like funding wallet, sending

                    to see how real users interacted with the app and spot areas for improvement early on.

                        parameters such as currency, exchange rate and time posted and apply the filters.

                        3. Introduced predefined chat messages to prevent off-platform negotiations.<br>

                        amount posted also they can't type 10 digits which is equivalent to phone number.

                    <p class="about__description">As the company grows, there will be some iterations like, 
                        improving existing features, refining flows, and adding new solutions as user needs evolve.
                        The most important lesson I learnt from this project is constantly asking for feedback from the 
                        users to be able to reveal the gap in the design. Especially in a start-up environment
                        as a sole designer. Which has helped me grow as a designer, taking ownership of the entire 
                        design process.
